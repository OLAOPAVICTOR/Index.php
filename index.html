                        <span class="sub-head">PASSION</span><br>
                        First and foremost, every innovation starts with a passion.
                        No matter how tough something seems to be, the only point where progress stops, is that point where passion vanishes.
                        I, <b>Victor Olaopa</b>, am very passionate about Software development [<i>Reason I am a FavCoder.</i>]. 
                        It is something I am always interested to discuss about, and I'm always open to learn from anyone.
                        I Strongly believe that this priceless opportunity will thrust me a great distance further to achieving my dreams.
                        Technology, is what I am here for and I am very bold to Say that no matter what may come my way,
                        I'll always be at the forefront of innovation.<br><br>
                        
                        <span class="sub-head">COLLABORATION</span><br>
                        Sincerely speaking, this will be my first time ever to work under an honorable organization.
                        This means one important thing, collaboration is sure. I do not see this as a scenario to attract
                        human pity/sympathy to me. I am someone who you won't regret working with, as I believe Tell Em' needs someone Who is very dedicated.
                        This is a priceless gift to build myself. I want to be engaged continuously on things like this, things that
                        involve like minded dudes. Something I have always done selflessly. I love collaboration alot. I love innovation.<br><br>
                        
                        <span class="sub-head">SELF-IMPROVEMENT</span><br>
                        Yeah! It might be true after all...<br>
                        my little <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>[only] implemented site, might be classless.
                        It might be whacky. But I tell you something, it is not bound to be permanent.
                        I haven't attained the most I wish. I'm sure that in no time, I'll be a 1000 percent better than I am today.
                        This is just to say that getting accepted as a <b>Tell Em'</b> employee into any division,whether I am present physically or otherwise,
                        gives room for self improvement.
                        Believe me, when I say that this little project I am being given to handle stretched me a bit.
                        This is to say that I need things that will challenge me. No matter How little.
                        I believe by the grace of God I am limitless in what ever I set out to achieve.<br>
                        Like some guys who had their internship in some company testified to their ability being largely improved by working
                        with that particular company. Same is bound to happen here, cause I'm determined.
                        I also am assured that gaining Industrial experience as a Tell Em' Employee, would give me first hand experience, into the
                        reality of being a software developer. And Together, we build something great, and we go only one way....
